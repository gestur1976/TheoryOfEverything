# TheoryOfEverything
See [99_Background/Introduction-GPT-Conversation.md](99_Background/Introduction-GPT-Conversation.md)

## Repository Overview
This repository proposes a Theory of Everything emerging from fundamental principles rooted in the Spin(4) group isomorphisms. The framework begins with a state of absolute nothingness and progresses iteratively through logical steps, building complexity from differentiation, scaling, and emergent symmetries. Each state is described in detail, exploring its mathematical, physical, and conceptual implications.

## Overview
- **Core Idea:** Begin from a state of "nothingness" (Step 0), described as a unified state of fundamental forces with 4 degrees of freedom. From this foundation, progress iteratively by introducing differentiation, scale, and emergent operations.
- **Goal:** Describe a ToE where each step logically arises from the previous one, blending physics, geometry, and topology with a touch of fun and creativity.

## File Structure and Naming Convention
Our repository structure captures the iterative nature of this ToE, where each file corresponds to a conceptual "step" in the process. Here's the layout:

### Directory: 0_InitialState/
This directory explores the foundational steps of the theory, starting from absolute nothingness and progressively introducing differentiation, scale, duality, and iteration. Each step builds upon the last, forming a coherent narrative of emergent complexity.

### File Descriptions
1. **00_Nothing.md**: Describes the initial state of absolute nothingness.
2. **01_Unit.md**: Introduces the concept of the fundamental unit, such as the Planck scale.
3. **10_Scale.md**: Explores the concept of scaling and proportional relationships.
4. **11_Duality.md**: Examines duality as a complementary principle to differentiation and scale.
5. **100_NextIteration.md**: Investigates the iterative process of building new emergent states.
