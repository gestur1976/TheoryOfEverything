# Mandala Cosmos Theory
Provisional article [MandalaCosmosTheory.md](MandalaCosmosTheory.md) (under development).

## Repository Overview
This repository proposes a Theory of Everything emerging from fundamental principles rooted in the Spin(4) group isomorphisms. The framework begins with a state of absolute nothingness and progresses iteratively through logical steps, building complexity from differentiation, scaling, and emergent symmetries. Each state is described in detail, exploring its mathematical, physical, and conceptual implications.

## Overview
- **Core Idea:** Begin from a state of "nothingness" (Step 0), described as a unified state of fundamental forces with 4 degrees of freedom. From this foundation, progress iteratively by introducing differentiation, scale, and emergent operations.
- **Goal:** Describe a ToE where each step logically arises from the previous one, blending physics, geometry, and topology with a touch of fun and creativity.
