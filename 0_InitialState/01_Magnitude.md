## Description
Magnitude arises as a measurable extension of the Unit. It enables differentiation and comparison between units, introducing scale and relative proportions.


### Key Properties
- **Differentiation:** Creates measurable distinctions between states.
- **Planck Scale Reference:** Connects to the smallest measurable quantities in the physical universe.
- **Quantifiable Information:** Allows for the encoding of complexity in terms of relative values.

### Analogy
Think of a ruler divided into increments. Magnitude is the ability to distinguish between these increments and define their relative sizes.
