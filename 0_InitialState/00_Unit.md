### 00_Unit.md

## Description
The fundamental unit introduces the first measurable magnitude into the system, providing a reference for all subsequent differentiation. This unit can be linked to the Planck scale, the smallest possible unit of measurement in space, time, and energy.

### Key Properties
- **Quantization:** Establishes a discrete foundation for measurement.
- **Planck Scale:** Acts as a universal minimum for length, time, and energy.
- **Anchor for Differentiation:** Enables the comparison and structuring of subsequent states.

### Analogy
Think of a single grain of sand in a vast desert. This smallest unit forms the basis for constructing dunes, yet by itself, conveys simplicity.
