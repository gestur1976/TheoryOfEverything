# Step 4: Next Iteration

## Description
The next iteration builds upon the foundational principles of nothingness, differentiation, scale, and duality. It introduces recursion and self-similarity, enabling the system to evolve through repetition at increasing levels of complexity.

### Key Properties
- **Recursion:** Applies the same principles iteratively to generate new structures.
- **Self-Similarity:** Preserves patterns across scales, fostering fractal-like growth.
- **Emergence:** Gives rise to novel properties and behaviors through repeated interactions.

### Analogy
Imagine the growth of a snowflake. Its intricate structure arises from the repeated application of simple principles, creating beauty and complexity from fundamental symmetry.
