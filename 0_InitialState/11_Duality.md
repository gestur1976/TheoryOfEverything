# Step 3: Duality

## Description
Duality introduces the concept of complementary opposites, such as positive and negative, or action and reaction. This interplay is essential for the dynamic evolution of the system and the breaking of symmetry.

### Key Properties
- **Complementary Opposites:** Balances contrasting properties or forces.
- **Dynamic Interaction:** Enables evolution and complexity.
- **Symmetry Breaking:** Facilitates the transition from uniformity to diversity.

### Analogy
Consider a magnet with a north and south pole. The interaction between these poles creates a dynamic field, an emergent property of their duality.

**Next Step:** Investigate how iteration builds on duality to form new emergent states in [100_NextIteration.md](100_NextIteration.md).
