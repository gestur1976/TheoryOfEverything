# Step 2: Scaling

## Description
Scaling introduces proportional relationships between the fundamental unit and larger magnitudes. It allows for the development of hierarchy, structure, and complexity.

### Key Properties
- **Relative Measurement:** Provides the ability to compare magnitudes.
- **Hierarchy Creation:** Constructs layers of complexity from basic units.
- **Dimensional Foundations:** Establishes a framework for space and time.

### Analogy
Envision a staircase. Each step represents a unit, and the staircase as a whole signifies a scalable progression in height and distance.
