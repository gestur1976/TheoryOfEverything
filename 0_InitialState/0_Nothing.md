# Step 0: Nothing

## Description
Nothingness represents the absolute symmetry of the initial state. It is devoid of structure, magnitude, or differentiation. This state serves as the foundation from which all phenomena and complexity arise.

### Key Properties
- **Absolute Symmetry:** A state with no distinctions, directions, or measurable properties.
- **Potential for Emergence:** Lays the groundwork for differentiation and complexity.
- **4 Degrees of Freedom:** Encodes the latent capacity for defining spatial or conceptual dimensions.

### Analogy
Imagine a calm, infinite ocean with no waves, currents, or boundaries. It is perfectly uniform, yet full of potential for motion.
