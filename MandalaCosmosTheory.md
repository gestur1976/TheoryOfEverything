# **Mandala Cosmos Theory**  
*by Josep F. Hervàs Fuertes*

## **Introduction: A New Name, A New Vision**

**Why “Mandala Cosmos Theory”?**  
The term “Mandala” originates from ancient Sanskrit, meaning “circle” or “wholeness.” In Hindu, Buddhist, and other spiritual traditions, mandalas are geometric diagrams that represent the universe itself—a microcosm reflecting the macrocosm. This symbol of **cosmic unity** resonates profoundly with the **dodecahedral tessellation** and **symmetry-breaking** concepts at the heart of the framework proposed here. Just as a mandala visually embodies interconnectedness and infinite iteration, the **Mandala Cosmos Theory** asserts that reality’s discrete geometry iterates at every scale, creating a self-referential web of cosmic design.

**Mythic and Archetypal Inspiration**  
Throughout human history, geometry and cosmology have converged in sacred symbols. The **Uróboros**, often depicted as a serpent swallowing its own tail, is an emblem of cyclicality, unity, and self-reflexivity. Such ancient symbols inspire this theory by illustrating how **local** actions (the serpent’s mouth) and **global** structure (the serpent’s entire form) remain intertwined. In the Mandala Cosmos Theory, each dodecahedron “cell” connects to a universal lattice, reinforcing the timeless notion that “as above, so below.”

## **1. The Dodecahedral Lattice: Foundation of Reality**

### **1.1 The Geometry of the Mandala**

At the theory’s core lies a **tessellation of inverted and opposed dodecahedrons**, analogous to petals in a mandala. Each **dodecahedral cell** is a localized region of space where physical interactions occur, constrained by a **geometric blueprint**:

- **Dodecahedron (\(\mathbf{N}\)):** A 3D polyhedron with 12 pentagonal faces, 20 vertices, and 30 edges.  
- **Lattice Structure (\(\mathcal{A}\)):** The universe is represented by a graph \(\mathbf{T}(F, G)\), where \(F\) indicates the centers of these cells and \(G\) the connections between them.  
- **Dual Geometry:** Each cell \(\mathbf{N}\) pairs with an inverted counterpart \(\mathbf{N}^{+}\), reflecting the mirror-like dualities found in many mystical doctrines (light/dark, yin/yang).

By combining these geometric cells in an endlessly repeating pattern—like the concentric circles of a mandala—this framework provides both **local** and **cosmic** consistency. The repeated *shape-within-a-shape* motif echoes the **Uróboros** concept, suggesting a self-sustaining and self-referential universe.

### **1.2 Bridging Discrete and Continuous Space**

The dodecahedral lattice fuses **discrete** topological points (cells) with emergent **continuous** properties (spacetime curvature). In esoteric traditions, mandalas serve to illustrate how finite boundaries (the outer circle) contain infinite forms and layers. Likewise, the Mandala Cosmos Theory resolves local events within a global context, symbolizing how singular vertices can accumulate to shape large-scale cosmic structures.

## **2. Proportions and Lucas Numbers**

### **2.1 Sacred Numbers, Sacred Geometry**

Just as mandalas often incorporate numerical patterns symbolizing cosmic order (e.g., the **number eight** in Buddhism, the **108** beads of a mala), this framework integrates the **Lucas sequence** \(\{\mathcal{i}_i\}\) as its key numerical progression. Related to the Fibonacci sequence, Lucas numbers appear in **spiral phyllotaxis** and other natural growth processes, reinforcing the idea that **nature’s geometry** may underlie cosmic structure.

\[
\mathcal{i}_i = 
\begin{cases}
2, & i = 0,\\
1, & i = 1,\\
\mathcal{i}_{i-1} + \mathcal{i}_{i-2}, & i > 1.
\end{cases}
\]

### **2.2 Cycle Graph Representation**

Each dodecahedron \(\mathbf{N}\) corresponds to a **cycle graph** \(\mathbf{Q}_r\), where \(r\) is a Lucas number \(\mathcal{i}_i\). At each vertex, **threefold symmetry** echoes the ancient triad symbolism found worldwide (e.g., the Hindu Trimūrti, the Celtic triskelion). This triple branching becomes the basis for **probabilistic transitions**—an essential ingredient in quantum-like processes.

---

## **3. Symmetry Breaking as the Cosmic Unfolding**

### **3.1 The Tetrahedron and the Uróboros**

To illustrate how the universe transitions from a **pristine oneness** into multiplicity, the Mandala Cosmos Theory introduces a thought experiment:

1. **Initial State of Unity:** Four entities occupy the vertices of a tetrahedron, symbolizing a perfect equilibrium—a microcosmic Uróboros with no defined properties.  
2. **First Disturbance:** A single vertex shifts, **breaking** the symmetry, forging distinctions like distance and angle. In mystical terms, this act births the universe, echoing creation myths where a primeval “egg” or “void” cracks open to reveal **duality**.  
3. **Iterative Differentiation:** Repeated symmetry breakings generate a hierarchy of scales, much like expanding concentric mandalas. Forces, dimensions, and structures flow from these initial perturbations.

### **3.2 Echoes in Myth and Mysticism**

Such a process—an “original” perfect state giving way to a structured multiplicity—parallels countless creation tales, from the splitting of the cosmic egg in Chinese mythology to the separation of sky and earth in Greek lore. In the Mandala Cosmos Theory, **geometry** is the prime mover that orchestrates these transformations.

## **4. The Universe as an Eulerian Path**

### **4.1 Evolution Through Graph Traversal**

Much as a **mantra** recited in a mandala ritual systematically traverses layers of consciousness, the Mandala Cosmos Theory posits that the universe evolves via **Eulerian paths** on the graph \(\mathbf{T}(F, G)\). An Eulerian path visits every edge **exactly once**:

- **State Configurations:** Each discrete step along the path corresponds to a **unique cosmic state**.  
- **Causality and Non-Reversal:** The path cannot “rewind,” reflecting the forward arrow of time.  

### **4.2 Conserving Energy and Information**

Because an Eulerian path includes each edge once without repetition, it innately mirrors **conservation laws**. This resonates with ancient alchemical principles (symbolized by the Uróboros) that “what is taken is restored,” signifying neither energy nor information is truly lost.

## **5. From Invisible Forces to Emergent Phenomena**

### **5.1 Dark Matter as Hidden Geometry**

- **Local Flatness Function:** Define \(W(n)\) to track how “flat” or “curved” a region of the lattice is. Subtle deviations in geometry produce gravitational effects reminiscent of **dark matter**.  
- **Archetypal Veil:** Just as mystical traditions speak of a “veil” that obscures reality, this hidden geometric curvature could be the “veil” behind phenomena we call **dark matter**.

### **5.2 Dark Energy and Cosmic Expansion**

- **Scalar Curvature (\(O\)):** Large-scale curvatures govern **non-uniform cosmic expansion**. The expansion rate \(\mathbf{U}(p) \propto 1/\sqrt{O}\) suggests an intrinsic, geometry-driven impetus for acceleration—akin to a cosmic **prāṇa** or life-force.  
- **Mystical Parallel:** The concept of cosmic breath or expansion resonates with many spiritual worldviews, emphasizing **eternal renewal** (the Uróboros swallowing itself).

### **5.3 Filaments, Voids, and the Cosmic Web**

- **Filament Convergence:** Where **Eulerian paths** converge, cosmic filaments form.  
- **Void Divergence:** Regions sparse in path traversal become cosmic voids.  
- **Mandala Imagery:** The spiderweb-like structure of galaxies and voids evokes the repeating radial geometry of mandalas, reinforcing the notion that **patterns at one scale** echo at another.

## **6. Quantum Branching: A Sacred Uncertainty**

### **6.1 Threefold Probability**

At the boundary of each dodecahedron, three edges branch out, reflecting the trifecta found in many spiritual traditions (e.g., the Holy Trinity, the triple goddess, the triple gem). Here:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{3} |m_i|^2 = 1,
\]

where \(m_i\) are probability amplitudes. This trifurcation implies a **geometric basis** for quantum indeterminacy rather than randomness emerging from nowhere—a nod to the symbolic power of triads.

### **6.2 Lucas Number Constraints**

Probability distributions are modulated by Lucas numbers \(\mathcal{i}_i\), implying the deep interplay of **sacred geometry** with quantum phenomena. This suggests the timeless principle that **order** (in the form of integer sequences) coexists with **apparent chaos** (quantum uncertainty).

## **7. Cosmological Echoes and Observational Avenues**

### **7.1 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)**

- **Geometric Anisotropies:** Temperature fluctuations in the CMB might encode dodecahedral symmetries. Detecting these **subtle geometric “fingerprints”** could bolster the Mandala Cosmos Theory.  
- **Mythic Correlation:** The swirl of cosmic background radiation can be seen as a **mandala** formed at the dawn of time, preserving traces of the universe’s earliest geometry.

### **7.2 Quasars as Diffraction Patterns**

- **Inverted Images:** Quasars could arise from **lattice-induced diffraction** or “inversion” effects. Their luminosity and redshift characteristics become less mysterious if they are projections shaped by **dodecahedral geometry**.  
- **Alchemical Luminosity:** Alchemists spoke of the “lumen naturae,” an inner light. Analogously, quasars might be the “inner light” shining through the cosmic lattice.

---

## **8. Predictions and Experimental Tests**

1. **Void and Filament Geometry:** Compare large-scale galaxy surveys (e.g., Vera C. Rubin Observatory) for **dodecahedral alignment** in the distribution of voids and filaments.  
2. **CMB Analysis:** Investigate the cosmic microwave background for **polygonal (or pentagonal) patterns** corresponding to a dodecahedral geometry.  
3. **Quasar Symmetry:** Seek evidence of **diffraction or inversion** around quasars that might confirm the predicted geometric effects.  
4. **Dark Matter Correlation:** Relate the geometric flatness function \(W(n)\) to gravitational lensing maps. A strong match would support the dodecahedral-lattice interpretation.  
5. **Evolution Over Time:** Monitor how cosmic structures evolve, testing whether **iterative symmetry-breaking** manifests at different epochs, thus reinforcing the mandala-like unfolding.

---

## **9. Challenges and Pathways Forward**

- **Discrete vs. Continuous:** How precisely do relativistic and quantum principles arise from the dodecahedral mesh?  
- **Gauge Symmetries:** Merging standard model fields (electroweak, strong) with geometric cells demands further exploration.  
- **Falsifiability:** Despite mystical and aesthetic appeal, the theory needs stringent observational tests.

## **Conclusion: Geometry as the Sacred Thread**

**Mandala Cosmos Theory,** authored by **Josep F. Hervàs Fuertes**, re-envisions the universe as an ever-unfolding mandala of **dodecahedrons**, intricately connected via **Lucas sequence** proportions and **Eulerian paths**. Drawing on ancient symbols—like the **Uróboros**, which embodies the cyclical return of creation and destruction—this theory unites modern discrete-geometric physics with mythic archetypes.

By regarding geometry not merely as a tool but as the **foundational reality** itself, the Mandala Cosmos Theory underscores a timeless truth found in mystical, philosophical, and scientific traditions alike: the universe is *patterned*, *harmonic*, and ultimately **self-referential**. Whether we gaze upon a mandala in a Tibetan monastery or measure cosmic filaments through telescopes, we witness the **living geometry** that shapes our cosmos. The stage is set for a new era of exploration, where science and symbolism converge to deepen our understanding of both **outer space** and **inner meaning**—a union as ancient as humanity and as boundless as the mandala itself.
